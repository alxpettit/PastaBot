# PastaBot

A simple roverbot design with a completely arbitrary name

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alxpettit/PastaBot.svg?branch=master)]

_Note about build status: due to a library conflict involving IRremote, travis-ci is unable to build `ir_control.ino` (the sample program for controlling the PastaBot with IR). Thus, the build status will not reflect the status of that example code until after I've figured out some way to fix this. The problem seems to be related to [this](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote/issues/53). See [here](https://gist.github.com/alxpettit/0bd7e66ce579c17bc995ce25ff06bc46) for the build log, if you're curious._

IR control example requires the [Arduino-IRremote](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote) library.
